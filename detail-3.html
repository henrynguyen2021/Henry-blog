        <h2> Cream Cheese Pound Cake</h2><br>
        <p> This fluff vanilla cake recipe is the absolute best yellow cake from scratch and paired with the silky smooth chocolate frosting, you can't beat it for a classic birthday cake or any other celebration!</p>
        <img class="img" src="Images/Yellow.jpg" alt="Yellow">
        <p>Are you box the mix yellow Cake person? Or a from-scracth yellow cake person?</p><br>
        <p> Truth be told, it's REALLY hard to replicate that always moist and fluffy texture that everyone loves about a box cake mix, but ath the same time, we also love homemade right?</p><br>
        <P>It took me a LONG time to fine a home made yellow cake that I really, really loved. Box cake mixes seem to always bake up perfectly fluffy and moist yellow Cake, and the one I've had from bakeries have beeen great as well, but I just coudn't seem
            to replicate it at home no matter how many recipes I try. (Consequently, I haven'n had the same issue with chocolate Cake! See, Snicker Cake - the base recipe for all of my chocolate Cake!)</P><br>
        <p>Many were too dense, too dry, too chifffon-like, to fussy in their preparation. I just wanted a fanstatic yellow cake recipe I could use for birthday cake that was easy to make and turned out delicious. I came arrcoss this recipe from Joy while
            I was on the hunt for yet another recipe to test out for Joseph's birthday</p><br>
        <p> That was IT. The recipe that had enluded me for years</p><br>

        <p>
            I love that this can easily to mixed together in one bowl, there's nothing fussy abot the ingredients or preparation, and it produce an absolutely perfect yellow Cake. The layers are light but sturdy, buttery and moist, and the iseal base for your favorite
            chocolate frosting.</p><br>
        <p> I use chocolate frosting recipe from my ultimate upcakes, it was a wonderful companion to this cake. The frosting is more buttery than sugary, satiny smooth and full of rich chocolate flavor. I glides on like a dream.</p><br>

        <p>Yellow cake tend to be the elusive unicorn of homemade baking, so many cakes tunrn too dry, too crumbly, too dense, too cornbread-like, and I have one major piece of advice for ensuring yellow cake perfection</p><br>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Make sure all the ingredients listed at rooom temperature "ARE ACTUALLY AT ROOM TEMPARATURE"</h2><br>
        <p>I've totally been there and have used still-cool-butter, egg or dairy in a recipe when I'm in a hurry, but it's actually vitally important here. Have ving all of thoese ingredients at room temperature ensure they that emulsify, wwhich traps air
            in the batter and, that aire expands and prooduces a fluffy cake</p><br>
        <p>Room temperature ingredients also ensure that the batter comes together and is ultra-smooth, wwhich keep the resulting cake from being crumbly or cornbread-like.</p><br>
